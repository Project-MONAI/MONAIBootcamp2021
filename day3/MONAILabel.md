## MONAI Label

To get you more familiar with MONAI Label, we encourage you to try setting up your own MONAI Label server. 

**Requirements:**

Installation
- Install MONAI Label

Setup a MONAI Label Server
- Download the MSD dataset (i.e. left atrium (MR) or spleen (CT) ) 
- Link to datasets: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HqEgzS8BV2c7xYNrZdEAnrHk7osJJ--2

Use 3D Slicer to
-	Use scribbles to annotate some images
-	Submit at least one image for training

Use available pretrained models to
-	Annotate an image using DeepEdit App
-	Annotate an image using 2D DeepGrow
-	Annotate an image using 3D DeepGrow


These tasks require you to set up MONAI Label on your machine along with the viewer of your choice. Youâ€™ll also get started using one of the sample applications to create an annotation and see what the workflow looks like for a MONAI Label user.
