## MONAI Deploy

To get you more familiar with MONAI Deploy, we encourage you to set up a deployment pipeline for one of the other models in the mini-challenges, using one of your existing models or using a pre-trained model.

**Requirements:**

Training (Optional):
- Complete one of the other mini-challenges to train your model
- The Spleen Segmentation challenge would work well for this challenge
- Use an existing model.  Either from PyTorch Hub or your own model.

Create your Application Class:
- Setup Imports
- Create Operator Classes
- Create Application Classes

Package your App:
- Use the MONAI Application Packager (MAP) to create a Docker container

Testing your App:
- Execute a sample inference using the newly packaged Docker container


These tasks will help you explore the process of an end-to-end workflow from Training to Deployment using MONAI Deploy App SDK.
